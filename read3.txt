8 dS/m. Salinity is usually below 4 dS/m during
the monsoon season, starts to increase during
December and is at its maximum during
March–April. The differences in characteristics
between saline and non-saline soils may be

soils may contain more potassium than nonsaline
soils, but potassium saturation of the
former would be lower than that
